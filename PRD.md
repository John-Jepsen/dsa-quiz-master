# Data Structures & Algorithms Quiz Game

An interactive quiz application that helps students master data structures and algorithms concepts through engaging, progressively challenging questions with detailed explanations and performance tracking.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Educational** - Clear explanations and learning-focused feedback that builds understanding rather than just testing knowledge
2. **Progressive** - Adaptive difficulty that challenges users appropriately based on their current skill level and performance
3. **Engaging** - Gamified elements like scoring, streaks, and achievements that motivate continued learning

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Multiple quiz categories, progress tracking, and scoring system with persistent user data but no complex user accounts or advanced functionality

## Essential Features

### Quiz Taking System
- **Functionality**: Present multiple-choice questions about data structures and algorithms with immediate feedback
- **Purpose**: Core learning mechanism that tests and reinforces knowledge
- **Trigger**: User selects a topic category and starts quiz
- **Progression**: Topic selection → Question display → Answer selection → Immediate feedback → Explanation → Next question → Final score
- **Success criteria**: Questions display correctly, answers are validated, explanations are shown, progress tracked

### Topic Categories
- **Functionality**: Organize questions by DS&A topics (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Allow focused study on specific areas and track progress per topic
- **Trigger**: User navigates to quiz selection screen
- **Progression**: Category browse → Topic selection → Difficulty choice → Quiz start
- **Success criteria**: Categories are clearly organized, topics are comprehensive, difficulty levels are balanced

### Progress Tracking
- **Functionality**: Track scores, completion rates, and performance trends over time
- **Purpose**: Show learning progress and identify areas needing improvement
- **Trigger**: Automatic after each quiz completion
- **Progression**: Quiz completion → Score calculation → Progress update → Statistics display
- **Success criteria**: Data persists between sessions, trends are visualizable, insights are actionable

### Explanation System
- **Functionality**: Detailed explanations for each answer including time/space complexity analysis
- **Purpose**: Reinforce learning and explain the reasoning behind correct answers
- **Trigger**: After user submits answer (correct or incorrect)
- **Progression**: Answer submission → Immediate feedback → Detailed explanation → Continue option
- **Success criteria**: Explanations are comprehensive, include complexity analysis, help understanding

## Edge Case Handling

- **Empty Quiz State**: Show getting started guide when no quizzes have been taken
- **All Questions Completed**: Cycle back to beginning or suggest reviewing weak areas
- **Invalid Answers**: Prevent submission without selection, handle malformed question data gracefully
- **Progress Loss**: Graceful degradation if saved progress is corrupted or unavailable
- **Long Explanations**: Scrollable content areas that don't break layout on mobile devices

## Design Direction

The design should feel focused and academic yet approachable - clean and organized like a well-structured textbook but with modern interactive elements that make learning engaging rather than overwhelming.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a blue-orange palette where blue conveys trust and knowledge while orange provides energy and motivation for learning achievements.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates reliability, knowledge, and academic focus
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue (oklch(0.85 0.08 240)) for backgrounds and Neutral Gray (oklch(0.65 0 0)) for supporting text
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 45)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for correct answers, achievements, and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 16.0:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue oklch(0.96 0.02 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 14.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.70 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey clarity and professionalism appropriate for educational content, using Inter for its excellent readability and modern appearance that works well for both interface elements and code snippets.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Quiz Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Category Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Question Text): Inter Medium/20px/relaxed line height
  - Body (Explanations): Inter Regular/16px/comfortable line height
  - Code (Algorithms): JetBrains Mono/14px/monospace for code examples
  - UI Labels: Inter Medium/14px/uppercase tracking

## Animations

Animations should support the learning process with subtle feedback that confirms actions and smooth transitions that maintain focus on educational content rather than flashy effects.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Use gentle micro-interactions to confirm answer selections and celebrate correct responses, with smooth page transitions that maintain context during quiz flow
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Answer feedback gets primary animation focus (color changes, gentle bounces), followed by progress indicators, with minimal decoration on navigation elements
