Implement code splitting and lazy loading to improve initial bundle load time and overall application performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add lazy loading for quiz modules  
- [ ] Split vendor dependencies into separate chunks
- [ ] Reduce initial bundle size by at least 40%
- [ ] Maintain functionality across all routes

## Implementation Notes
- Use React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level splitting
- Configure Vite's rollupOptions for manual chunks
- Add loading states for lazy-loaded components
- Test performance improvements with Lighthouse" \

Analyze and optimize the current bundle size to improve load times and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current bundle composition with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and dead code
- [ ] Implement tree shaking for better optimization
- [ ] Reduce bundle size to under 500KB gzipped
- [ ] Document optimization strategies

## Implementation Notes
- Use \`npm run build\` with bundle analysis
- Review all imported libraries for usage
- Consider replacing heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical features" \

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create service worker for caching static assets
- [ ] Implement offline quiz functionality
- [ ] Add offline indicator in UI
- [ ] Cache quiz data and user progress locally
- [ ] Handle online/offline synchronization

## Implementation Notes
- Use Workbox for service worker management
- Cache critical assets and API responses
