# DSA Quiz Master

A lean DSA quiz playground. The repo surface stays quiet; details live in `docs/`.

## Quickstart
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` for local play
- `npm run build` for production
- `npm test` for Vitest + React Testing Library
- `npm run lint` to enforce style

## Notes
- Profiles, quizzes, and leaderboards run fully in-browser (IndexedDB).
- Deploy via GitHub Pages; see `docs/deployment.md` when you need the steps.
- Architecture, auth, and data guides sit in the rest of the `docs/` folder for when the mystery needs lifting.
