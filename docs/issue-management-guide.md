# Issue Management Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use GitHub issues to track work and contribute to the DSA Quiz Master project.

## üìã Quick Start

1. **Review the [GitHub Issues List](./github-issues-list.md)** for pre-defined issues ready to be created
2. **Use appropriate issue templates** when creating new issues
3. **Apply proper labels and milestones** for organization
4. **Follow the issue lifecycle** from creation to closure

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels System

### Type Labels (Required)
- `enhancement` - New features and improvements
- `bug` - Bug fixes and error corrections  
- `documentation` - Documentation updates
- `testing` - Testing-related issues

### Status Labels (Auto-applied)
- `status: ready` - Ready for development
- `status: in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status: review` - Pending review
- `status: blocked` - Blocked by dependencies

## üéØ Milestones

- Security improvements
- Essential documentation
- Basic testing setup
- Critical bug fixes

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Q2)
Improvements to functionality and quality:
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced testing
- API improvements
- Code quality improvements

### Phase 3: Polish (Q3)
User experience and advanced features:
- User experience enhancements
- Advanced features
- Comprehensive documentation
- Monitoring and analytics

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Q4)
Long-term sustainability:
- Community features
- Advanced integrations
- Future planning
- Maintenance improvements

## üìù Issue Templates

Use these templates for consistent, well-structured issues:

### Feature Request (`feature_request.md`)
For new features and enhancements
- **When to use:** Requesting new functionality
- **Required sections:** Description, Motivation, Acceptance Criteria
- **Labels:** `enhancement`, priority level

### Bug Report (`bug_report.md`)
For reporting bugs and errors
- **When to use:** Something isn't working as expected
- **Required sections:** Steps to reproduce, Expected vs Actual behavior
- **Labels:** `bug`, priority level

### Documentation (`documentation.md`)
For documentation improvements
- **When to use:** Missing or unclear documentation
- **Required sections:** Type, Target audience, Acceptance criteria
- **Labels:** `documentation`, priority level

### Testing (`testing.md`)
For testing-related tasks
- **When to use:** Need to add or improve tests
- **Required sections:** Testing type, Scope, Success metrics
- **Labels:** `testing`, priority level

### Performance (`performance.md`)
For performance optimizations
- **When to use:** Performance issues or optimization opportunities
- **Required sections:** Current state, Performance goals, Metrics
- **Labels:** `performance`, priority level

### Security (`security.md`)
For security improvements
- **When to use:** Security vulnerabilities or enhancements
- **Required sections:** Risk level, Impact, Verification
- **Labels:** `security`, priority level

## üîÑ Issue Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- Choose appropriate template
- Fill in all required sections
- Apply correct labels and milestone
- Link related issues if applicable

### 2. Triage
- Project maintainers review and validate
- Adjust priority and labels if needed
- Add to appropriate project board
- Assign if developer is available

### 3. Development
- Update status to `status: in-progress`
- Create branch following naming convention
- Implement solution following acceptance criteria
- Create pull request when ready

### 4. Review
- Update status to `status: review`
- Code review by maintainers
- Address feedback and iterate
- Update documentation if needed

### 5. Closure
- Merge pull request
- Close issue with reference to PR
- Update related documentation
- Announce completion if significant

## üöÄ Creating Issues from the Pre-defined List

The [GitHub Issues List](./github-issues-list.md) contains 32 ready-to-use issues. To create them:

1. **Copy the issue content** from the list
2. **Create new GitHub issue** using appropriate template
3. **Paste and adapt content** to fit template format
4. **Apply suggested labels and milestone**
5. **Link dependencies** mentioned in the issue

### Quick Creation Process
```bash
# Example for Issue #1: Code Splitting
1. Go to GitHub Issues ‚Üí New Issue
2. Select "Feature Request" template
3. Copy content from "Issue #1" in the issues list
4. Apply labels: enhancement, performance, priority: high
5. Set milestone: Phase 2
6. Create issue
```

## üìä Issue Tracking Best Practices

### For Contributors
- **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
- **Use clear, descriptive titles** that explain the issue
- **Provide complete information** using templates
- **Update issues** with progress and findings
- **Reference issues in commits** using `#issue-number`

### For Maintainers
- **Review and triage** new issues promptly
- **Apply consistent labeling** for organization
- **Update milestones** based on priorities
- **Close resolved issues** with appropriate references
- **Maintain project board** with current status

## üîç Finding Issues to Work On

### Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled:
- `priority: low` + `documentation`
- `testing` + small scope
- `enhancement` + clear requirements

### High Impact Issues
Look for issues labeled:
- `priority: high` + `bug`
- `security` + any priority
- `performance` + measurable goals

### Learning Opportunities
Look for issues labeled:
- `enhancement` + new technologies
- `testing` + unfamiliar testing types
- `documentation` + areas you want to learn

## üìà Metrics and Monitoring

### Issue Health Metrics
- **Issue resolution time** by priority level
- **Bug vs enhancement ratio** in active issues
- **Documentation coverage** by feature area
- **Testing coverage** by component

### Project Health Indicators
- **Low number of `priority: high` bugs**
- **Steady progress** on milestone completion
- **Active community participation** in discussions
- **Regular updates** to documentation

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Issue Etiquette
- **Be respectful** in all communications
- **Provide constructive feedback** on proposals
- **Ask for clarification** when requirements are unclear
- **Share knowledge** and help other contributors

### Communication
- **Use issue comments** for technical discussions
- **Tag relevant people** with @mentions when needed
- **Update status** when working on issues
- **Celebrate completions** and acknowledge contributors
