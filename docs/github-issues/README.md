## Total Development Effort

- **Total Issues**: 33 (1 master + 32 individual modules)
- **Total Questions Needed**: 94 new questions
- **Current Questions**: 41
- **Target Questions**: 135

## Usage Instructions

1. Create the master issue first using `00-master-issue.md`
2. Create individual module issues as needed using the numbered files
3. Link individual issues back to the master issue
4. Use the checklist in the master issue to track progress
5. Close individual issues as modules are completed
6. Close master issue when all 94 questions are implemented

## Labels to Use

- `epic` - For the master issue
- `enhancement` - For all issues
- `content` - For all issues
- `questions` - For all issues
- Topic names: `arrays`, `linked-lists`, `stacks-queues`, `trees`, `graphs`, `sorting`
- Priority: `high`, `medium`, `low` (as indicated in each issue)

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1 (Existing Enhanced Topics)
1. Arrays - 16 questions
2. Linked Lists - 14 questions  
3. Stacks & Queues - 12 questions
4. Trees - 20 questions

### Phase 2 (New Enhanced Topics)
1. Graphs - 18 questions
2. Sorting - 14 questions

This structured approach ensures systematic completion of the enhanced quiz system with high-quality questions across all DSA topics.
