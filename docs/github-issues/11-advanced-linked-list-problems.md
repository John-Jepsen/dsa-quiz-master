## Topic: Linked-lists
## Module: Advanced Linked List Problems (`linked-lists-advanced`)

### Overview
This module currently has **0** questions but needs **5** total questions.  
**Gap: 5 additional questions needed**

### Questions to Add

1. **Reversing linked list in groups**
2. **Intersection point of two linked lists**
3. **Clone linked list with random pointers**
4. **Merge k sorted linked lists**
5. **LRU cache implementation using linked lists**

### Requirements
Each question should include:
- [ ] Clear, unambiguous question text
- [ ] 4 multiple choice options with one correct answer
- [ ] Comprehensive explanation of the correct answer
- [ ] Time complexity analysis (where applicable)
- [ ] Space complexity analysis (where applicable)
- [ ] Code examples (where helpful)
- [ ] Appropriate difficulty level
- [ ] Relevant tags for categorization

### Implementation Details
- **File to modify**: `src/lib/module-questions.ts`
- **Module ID**: `linked-lists-advanced`
- **Topic**: `linked-lists`
- **Difficulty**: Check module definition in `src/lib/quiz-modules.ts`

### Example Question Format
```typescript
{
    id: 'linked-lists-advanced-new-1',
    topic: 'linked-lists',
    moduleId: 'linked-lists-advanced',
    difficulty: 'beginner' as const, // or 'intermediate' or 'advanced'
    question: 'Your question text here?',
    options: [
        'Option A',
        'Option B', 
        'Option C',
        'Option D'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0, // Index of correct option (0-3)
    explanation: 'Detailed explanation of why the answer is correct...',
    timeComplexity: 'O(1)', // if applicable
    spaceComplexity: 'O(1)' // if applicable
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria
