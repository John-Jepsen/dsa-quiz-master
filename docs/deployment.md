     base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/YOUR-REPO-NAME/' : '/',
     ```
2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy DSA Quiz Master"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repo â†’ Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Live App
